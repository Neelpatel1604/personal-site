# Intro

With a diverse background in both sales and technology, I am currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Computer Engineering at [Sheridan College](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/). My professional journey began at [Parmar Boot House](https://parmarboothouse.com/), where I worked as a Sales Associate for 8 months. This role enhanced my customer interaction and sales strategies. Transitioning into the tech field, I served as a Software Technician at [Future Way-Institute of Multimedia](https://www.futurewayinstitute.com/) for a year, where I developed a strong foundation in software troubleshooting and technical support. Now, as I advance my education, my goal is to become a Cloud/DevOps Engineer within the next three years, combining my practical experience with academic knowledge to excel in the field.

# Some history
- When I was in 3rd grade, I used to go to my friend's house to play Subway Surfer on their tablet.

- In 6th grade, my uncle introduced me to video games like Power Rangers and racing games. That same year, I was also appreciated by my teacher for the first time because of my academic achievement of 92%.

- In 9th grade, I got my first smartphone, a Samsung. Then in 11th grade, I got my second smartphone, an iPhone 6s. During the COVID pandemic, I had trouble attending online classes due to its low battery life, and it also caused issues while playing PUBG. My aunt then bought me a Realme 9 Pro smartphone.
